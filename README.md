# Easy Light

Easy Light is a Visual Code theme for those who prefer light mode and avoid that halation effect.

> I personally like dark themes. However, there is a point in time when the  white letters appear to bleed into the black background

This theme tries to bring the "cool" stuff from dark themes and still be nice to eyes. 

## Examples

3. Select `Easy Light` as the Color Theme. [Instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme). 


## Feedback

This is my first try into creating a VS Code theme. 

If you have suggestions or see something that can be improved, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fransyrcc/easy-light-vscode-theme/issues) or better yet, create a [pull request](https://github.com/fransyrcc/easy-light-vscode-theme/pulls).

That would be awesome!

## Useful Extensions

### Peacock for Visual Studio Code
Do you find yourself with multiple VS Code instances opened at once? This extension is pretty cool if you want to easily identify them. [See Peacock documentation](https://www.peacockcode.dev/)

### Bracket Pair Colorizer
This extension will give matching colors to your brackets. 

However, VS Code has a native bracket pair colorization. To enable it, open your user settings via `CMD` (`CTRL` for non-Mac users) + `Shift` + `P` and type settings to open the settings JSON file.

Add the following:

```
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
```
